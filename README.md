Bayesian Knowledge Tracing


Requires: Matlab and https://github.com/bayesnet/bnt

This is the best BKT implementation I can collect from various places. I also did some edit for reading files, doing cross-validation and generatring performance results. Still, code audit is needed! 

Yes, I really believe this is the BEST BKT implmentation in Matlab we can get.
